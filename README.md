# Basic ExpressJS


Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features for handling routing, request and response objects, middleware, and more.

To use Express, you first need to install it using npm (Node Package Manager) and then import it into your project. You can then create an Express application by calling the express() function. Once you have an Express application, you can use it to define routes and handle requests. For example, you can use the app.get() method to handle HTTP GET requests and the app.post() method to handle HTTP POST requests.

Express also allows you to use middleware functions, which are functions that are executed before the final route handler. These functions can be used for things like authentication, logging, and error handling.

Express also provides a lot of functionality out of the box to handle requests and responses, parsing request bodies, handling cookies and sessions, and more. It also has a large ecosystem of middleware and libraries that you can use to add additional functionality to your application.
